# FixCrossFades
After Effects script that fixes crossfades in files that have been imported from Premiere into After Effects

When Premiere projects are imported into After Effects, the cross dissolves are not preserved. This script restores the cross dissolves from the original Premiere project.

To use the script, download the JSX file to any location and run it from After Effects.
